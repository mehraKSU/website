The functional responses of two predators at prey densities ranging from 20 to 120 whitefly eggs/leaf disc, and prey-stage preferences with different ratios of whitefly eggs and nymphs of two predatory beetles were investigated under laboratory conditions. Both beetle species showed Type II functional response with respect to MEAM1 and MED eggs, determined by the logistic regression model. Based on the observed predation parameters (handling time, attack rate, and the number of eggs consumed), *D. catalinae* seemed to be a more suitable biocontrol candidate for whitefly pests. Results indicated that both the beetle species preferred whitefly eggs over the early nymphal instars and they could consume 50 eggs per day. Although these findings are promising, their feeding potential needs to be evaluated further under greenhouse and semi-field conditions to confirm their efficacy against MEAM1 and MED whitefly.","tags":["B whitefly","Q whitefly","IPM","biological control","predatory beetle"],"title":"Functional response and prey stage preference of *Delphastus catalinae* and *D. pallidus* (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on *Bemisia tabaci* (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abraham M.

This program is funded under the USDA-NIFA’s Education and Workforce Development initiative. The purpose of the program is to train undergraduate students in research and extension. We will be training 35 students over the course of 4 years (2019 to 2022).\nEach student had an assigned mentor in either plant pathology, entomology, or agronomy departments. In addition to working with their mentors on their research or extension projects, the students also participated in professional development seminars, field trips, and FACT workshops. FACT stands for Food and Agriculture Cyberinformatics Tools. Our goal was to introduce students to a wide variety of topics related to modern plant health research; so that, they have enough data in hand to make a decision about what they would like to pursue for further studies.\nBased on the results of student surveys, the program was able to meet its goals. The success of the program is reflected in the level of skills that students gained over the short 9-week period. See below for some of the areas where students improved their knowledge and skills. These are a few examples of questions that we asked students in an anonymous survey.\nHow much did you gain in the following areas as a result of your research/extension experience in past nine weeks?\r\rScale: 1 = No gain, 2 = A little gain, 3 = Moderate gain, 4 = Good gain, 5 = Great gain\nAll students had a moderate to great gain in understanding of everyday researh work, confidence to contribute to science, and conducting scientific observations.\nDuring your research/extension experience, how much did you?\r\rScale: 1 = None, 2 = A little, 3 = Some, 4 = A fair amount, 5 = A great deal\nMajority of students felt like a scientist and were engaged in real-world science research.\n\rActivities\rFor a timeline of activities that we hosted over the summer, search #KSUplanthealthREEU hashtag on twitter or just click here.

Regardless of injury, plant growth (change in height), soil plant analysis development, and whole-plant dry biomass of all cultivars did not differ among saflufenacil rates. Field studies were conducted in Burgaw, NC, to determine the tolerance of nonbearing (3-yr-old and mature enough to produce fruit) southern highbush blueberry (‘Duke’) to saflufenacil application at pre-budbreak or during the vegetative growth stage. Treatments included three rates of saflufenacil (50, 100, and 200 g ha−1), glyphosate (870 g ae ha−1), glufosinate (1096 g ai ha−1), glyphosate (870 g ha−1) + saflufenacil (50 g ha−1), glufosinate (1096 g ha−1) + saflufenacil (50 g ha−1), and hexazinone (1,120 g ai ha−1), applied POST-directed to the soil surface beneath blueberry plants in a 76-cm band on both sides of the blueberry planting row. The maximum injury from treatments containing saflufenacil was ≤11% in both nonbearing and bearing blueberry. No negative effects on plant growth or fruit yield were observed from any treatments. Results from both greenhouse and field studies suggest that saflufenacil applied at 50 (1X commercial use rate) and 100 g ha−1 is safe to use in blueberry.","tags":["Glufosinate","glyphosate","hexazinone","saflufenacil","highbush blueberry","Vaccinium corymbosum L","rabbiteye blueberry","Vaccinium ashei","Injury","leaf abscission","reddening foliage","small fruit"],"title":"Tolerance of southern highbush and rabbiteye blueberry cultivars to saflufenacil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juliana K Buckelew","Wayne E Mitchem","David W Monks","Sushila Chaudhari","Katie M Jennings","Lucky Mehra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546387200,"objectID":"a330125fe09ff173a8dd81bb14cc1b21","permalink":"https://luckymehra.com/publication/2019-vegetation-free-peach/","publishdate":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-vegetation-free-peach/","section":"publication","summary":"Field experiments were conducted at two locations (Clayton and Jackson Springs, NC) to determine the influence of vegetation-free strip width (VFSW) and irrigation on newly planted peach growth and yield in a low-density orchard with a volunteer weedy ground cover.

Seasonal variation in the orchard floor vegetation was observed as different weed species reported in summer and winter. However, this difference was not apparent with respect to VFSF and irrigation. At Jackson Springs, NC, the predicted irrigated VFSW which would produce the same trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) as the grower standard (3-m nonirrigated) was 1.5, 1.3, and 0.8 m for one-, two-, and three-year-old trees, respectively. The predicted irrigated VFSW which would produce the same yield as the grower standard was 1.16 m. At Clayton, TCSA and fruit yield were not different by irrigation, but did increase linearly with VFSW. At both locations, leaf nitrogen (N) concentration was lower in irrigated trees than nonirrigated trees. Leaf N, leaf area, and SPAD were positively related to VFSW at Jackson Springs. In contrast, leaf N concentration was not different by VFSW at Clayton. However, leaf area and SPAD were positively related to VFSW at Clayton.

Historically, losses up to 50% have been reported, in addition to lower grain quality, although in the U.S., lower levels of loss are typical. The yield losses are highest when flag leaf, F-1 (leaf below flag leaf), and F-2 (leaf below F-1) are infected. The disease is known to reduce thousand-kernel-weight, a yield parameter.The fungus undergoes regular cycles of sexual recombination due to the availability of both mating types, and creates genetic variation in its population, thus enhancing its potential to overcome control measures.  The pathosystem is also a model system for necrotrophic plant pathogens. So far, nine necrotrophic effectors and host susceptibility gene interaction have been identified, which have the potential to be used in marker assisted selection for breeding resistant wheat varieties.","tags":["Parastagonospora nodorum","Stagonospora nodorum","Septoria nodorum","Phaeosphaeria nodorum","Leptosphaeria nodorum","Stagonospora nodorum blotch","wheat foliar disease","glume blotch"],"title":"Septoria nodorum blotch of wheat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kitherian Sahayaraj","Natarajan Subash","Robert W Allingham","Vivek Kumar","Pasco B Avery","Lucky Mehra","Cindy L McKenzie","Lance S Osborne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"ad7be411176f2ffe7a41f8c685f74eeb","permalink":"https://luckymehra.com/publication/2018-biocontrol-spodoptera/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-biocontrol-spodoptera/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Metarizhium anisopliae","Pseudomonas fluorescens","integrated pest management","field crop pest","nucleopolyhedrovirus","entomopathogens"],"title":"Lethal and sublethal effects of three microbial biocontrol agents on *Spodoptera litura* and its natural predator *Rhynocoris kumarii*","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christina Cowger","Lucky Mehra","Consuelo Arellano","Emily Meyers","J Paul Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521590400,"objectID":"a15e2e1abff5217a6b044656f6197e5e","permalink":"https://luckymehra.com/publication/2018-powdery-mildew/","publishdate":"2018-03-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-powdery-mildew/","section":"publication","summary":"Wheat powdery mildew is a disease of global importance that occurs across a wide geographic area in the United States. A virulence survey of *Blumeria graminis* f. sp. *tritici*, the causal agent, was conducted by sampling 36 wheat fields in 15 U.S. states in the years 2013 and 2014. Using a hierarchical sampling protocol, isolates were derived from three separated plants at each of five separated sites within each field in order to assess the spatial distribution of pathotypes. In total, 1,017 isolates from those fields were tested individually on single-gene differential cultivars containing a total of 21 powdery mildew resistance (Pm) genes. Several recently introgressed mildew resistance genes from wild wheat relatives (Pm37, Pm53, MlAG12, NCAG13, and MlUM15) exhibited complete or nearly complete resistance to all local *B. graminis* f. sp. *tritici* populations from across the sampled area. One older gene, Pm4b, also retained at least some efficacy across the sampled area. The *B. graminis* f. sp. *tritici* population sampled from Arkansas and Missouri, on the western edge of the eastern soft red winter wheat region, had virulence profiles more similar to other soft wheat mildew populations than to the geographically closer population from hard wheat fields in the Plains states of Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Kansas. The Plains population differed in that it was avirulent to several Pm genes long defeated in the soft-wheat-growing areas. Virulence complexity was greatest east of the Mississippi River, and diminished toward the west. Several recently introgressed Pm genes (Pm25, Pm34, Pm35, and NCA6) that are highly effective against mildew in the field in North Carolina were unexpectedly susceptible to eastern-U.S. *B. graminis* f. sp. *tritici* populations in detached-leaf tests. Sampled fields displayed a wide range of pathotype diversity and spatial distribution, suggesting that epidemics are caused by varying numbers of pathotypes in all regions. The research confirmed that most long-used Pm genes are defeated in the eastern United States, and the U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici population has different virulence profiles in the hard- and soft-wheat regions, which are likely maintained by host selection, isolation by distance, and west-to-east gene flow.","tags":["powdery mildew","gene frequency","survey"],"title":"Virulence Differences in *Blumeria graminis* f. sp. *tritici* from the Central and Eastern United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter S Ojiambo","David H Gent","Lucky Mehra","David Christie","Roger Magarey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1497916800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497916800,"objectID":"b4ac18b3655c33f001b43c7c2db35957","permalink":"https://luckymehra.com/publication/2017-stability-spread-parameter/","publishdate":"2017-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-stability-spread-parameter/","section":"publication","summary":"Empirical and mechanistic modeling indicate that pathogens transmitted via aerially dispersed inoculum follow a power law, resulting in dispersive epidemic waves.

Although SNB can occur prior to flag leaf emergence, the relationship between the time of disease onset and yield has not been determined. Such a relationship is useful in identifying a threshold to facilitate prediction of disease onset in the field. Disease occurred in 390 of 435 disease cases that were recorded across 11 counties in North Carolina from 2012 to 2014. Using cases with disease occurrence, the effect of disease onset on yield was analyzed to identify a disease onset threshold that related time of disease onset to yield. Regression analysis showed that disease onset explained 32% of the variation in yield (P 0.90. Performance of the disease onset model based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), κ, and the true skill statistic (TSS) was excellent, with prediction accuracy values 0.88.

In this study, we examined the performance of multiple regression (MR) and three machine learning algorithms namely artificial neural networks, categorical and regression trees, and random forests (RF), in predicting the pre-planting risk of SNB in wheat. Pre-planting factors tested as potential predictor variables were cultivar resistance, latitude, longitude, previous crop, seeding rate, seed treatment, tillage type, and wheat residue. Disease severity assessed at the end of the growing season was used as the response variable. The models were developed using 431 disease cases (unique combinations of predictors) collected from 2012 to 2014 and these cases were randomly divided into training, validation, and test datasets. Models were evaluated based on the regression of observed against predicted severity values of SNB, sensitivity-specificity ROC analysis, and the Kappa statistic. A strong relationship was observed between late-season severity of SNB and specific pre-planting factors in which latitude, longitude, wheat residue, and cultivar resistance were the most important predictors. The MR model explained 33% of variability in the data, while machine learning models explained 47 to 79% of the total variability. Similarly, the MR model correctly classified 74% of the disease cases, while machine learning models correctly classified 81 to 83% of these cases. Results show that the RF algorithm, which explained 79% of the variability within the data, was the most accurate in predicting the risk of SNB, with an accuracy rate of 93%. The RF algorithm could allow early assessment of the risk of SNB, facilitating sound disease management decisions prior to planting of wheat.","tags":["pre-planting risk","machine learning","random forests","neural networks","multiple regression","parastagonospora nodorum","septoria nodorum blotch"],"title":"Predicting pre-planting risk of Stagonospora nodorum blotch in winter wheat using machine learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucky Mehra","C Cowger","R Weisz","PS Ojiambo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1447804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1447804800,"objectID":"c22a0e3d71bbc4662fe354f266430607","permalink":"https://luckymehra.com/publication/2015-wheat-residue/","publishdate":"2015-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-wheat-residue/","section":"publication","summary":"Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), caused by the fungus *Parastagonospora nodorum*, is a major disease of wheat (*Triticum aestivum*).

Because the risk of infection is increased by fruit bruising, which in turn is increased by machine-harvesting, it has been difficult to harvest fruit from the early-maturing but soft-textured southern highbush blueberries (SHB) mechanically for the fresh market. This could change fundamentally with the recent development of SHB genotypes with crisp-textured (“crispy”) berries, i.e., fruit with qualitatively firmer flesh and/or more resistant skin. Four replicate row sections of two or three SHB genotypes having crispy fruit and three with conventional fruit were either hand- or machine-harvested at a commercial blueberry farm in northern Florida in April 2009 and May 2010. Harvested fruit were sorted, packed, and placed in cold storage (2°C) for up to 3 weeks. Average counts of aerobic bacteria, total yeasts and molds, coliforms, and Escherichia coli on fruit samples before the cold storage period were below commercial tolerance levels in most cases. In both years, natural disease incidence after cold storage was lowest for hand-harvested crispy fruit and highest for machine-harvested conventional fruit. Interestingly, machine-harvested crispy fruit had the same or lower disease incidence as hand-harvested conventional fruit. Across all treatments, natural postharvest disease incidence was inversely related to fruit firmness, with firmness values 220 g/mm associated with low disease. In separate experiments, samples from the 0-day cold storage period were inoculated at the stem end with *Alternaria alternata*, *Botrytis cinerea*, or *Colletotrichum acutatum*, and disease incidence was assessed after 7 days in a cold room followed by 60 to 72 h at room temperature. In response to artificial inoculation, less disease developed on crispy berries. No significant effect of harvest method was observed, except for *A. alternata* inoculation in 2009, when hand-harvested fruit developed a lower level of disease than machine-harvested fruit. Taken together, this study suggests that mechanical harvesting of SHB cultivars with crisp-textured berries is feasible from a postharvest pathology perspective.","tags":["southern highbush blueberry","postharvest rot","machine harvest","crisp-textured blueberry","Alternaria","Botrytis","colletotrichum"],"title":"Postharvest disease development on southern highbush blueberry fruit in relation to berry flesh type and harvest method","type":"publication"}]
