Saflufenacil treatments were soil applied into each pot when blueberry plants were approximately 30-cm tall.

Results suggested that *P. fluorescens* reduced the food consumption index, relative growth rate, approximate digestibility, the efficiency of conversion of ingested food, and the efficiency of conversion of digested food of *S. litura* third instar larvae compared to prey infected with *M. anisopliae* and SpltNPV. Both SpltNPV and *M. anisopliae* caused similar mortality of *S. litura* life stages after 96 h of observation. To observe the effect of an infected prey diet on predator behavior, infected *S. litura* larvae were offered to the third, fourth, and fifth instar nymphs of *R. kumarii*, and their prey handling time, predation rate (number/day/predator), developmental period, and the survival rate was recorded. When the life stages of *R. kumarii* were offered entomopathogen-infected *S. litura* larvae, their predation rate was comparable to or higher than the untreated control. The juvenile predator, after feeding on *P. fluorescens*-infected *S. litura* larvae, had a significantly longer developmental period (2–4 days) compared to those fed on larvae infected with other microbial control agents. However, feeding on *P. fluorescens* alone did not affect the predator nymphal survival rate or the adult sex ratio. Although three entomopathogens had some degree of effect on the biological parameters of *R. kumarii*, the outcome of this study suggests that integration of reduviids with the tested entomopathogens are a compatible and potentially effective strategy for the management of *S. litura* populations.

A virulence survey of *Blumeria graminis* f. sp. *tritici*, the causal agent, was conducted by sampling 36 wheat fields in 15 U.S. states in the years 2013 and 2014. Using a hierarchical sampling protocol, isolates were derived from three separated plants at each of five separated sites within each field in order to assess the spatial distribution of pathotypes. In total, 1,017 isolates from those fields were tested individually on single-gene differential cultivars containing a total of 21 powdery mildew resistance (Pm) genes. Several recently introgressed mildew resistance genes from wild wheat relatives (Pm37, Pm53, MlAG12, NCAG13, and MlUM15) exhibited complete or nearly complete resistance to all local B. graminis f. sp. tritici populations from across the sampled area. One older gene, Pm4b, also retained at least some efficacy across the sampled area. The B. graminis f. sp. tritici population sampled from Arkansas and Missouri, on the western edge of the eastern soft red winter wheat region, had virulence profiles more similar to other soft wheat mildew populations than to the geographically closer population from hard wheat fields in the Plains states of Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Kansas. The Plains population differed in that it was avirulent to several Pm genes long defeated in the soft-wheat-growing areas. Virulence complexity was greatest east of the Mississippi River, and diminished toward the west. Several recently introgressed Pm genes (Pm25, Pm34, Pm35, and NCA6) that are highly effective against mildew in the field in North Carolina were unexpectedly susceptible to eastern-U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici populations in detached-leaf tests. Sampled fields displayed a wide range of pathotype diversity and spatial distribution, suggesting that epidemics are caused by varying numbers of pathotypes in all regions. The research confirmed that most long-used Pm genes are defeated in the eastern United States, and the U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici population has different virulence profiles in the hard- and soft-wheat regions, which are likely maintained by host selection, isolation by distance, and west-to-east gene flow.","tags":null,"title":"Virulence differences in Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici from the central and eastern United States.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ojiambo, P.

In this study, we examined the performance of multiple regression (MR) and three machine learning algorithms namely artificial neural networks, categorical and regression trees, and random forests (RF), in predicting the pre-planting risk of SNB in wheat. Pre-planting factors tested as potential predictor variables were cultivar resistance, latitude, longitude, previous crop, seeding rate, seed treatment, tillage type, and wheat residue. Disease severity assessed at the end of the growing season was used as the response variable. The models were developed using 431 disease cases (unique combinations of predictors) collected from 2012 to 2014 and these cases were randomly divided into training, validation, and test datasets. Models were evaluated based on the regression of observed against predicted severity values of SNB, sensitivity-specificity ROC analysis, and the Kappa statistic. A strong relationship was observed between late-season severity of SNB and specific pre-planting factors in which latitude, longitude, wheat residue, and cultivar resistance were the most important predictors.

Because the risk of infection is increased by fruit bruising, which in turn is increased by machine-harvesting, it has been difficult to harvest fruit from the early-maturing but soft-textured southern highbush blueberries (SHB) mechanically for the fresh market. This could change fundamentally with the recent development of SHB genotypes with crisp-textured (“crispy”) berries, i.e., fruit with qualitatively firmer flesh and/or more resistant skin. Four replicate row sections of two or three SHB genotypes having crispy fruit and three with conventional fruit were either hand- or machine-harvested at a commercial blueberry farm in northern Florida in April 2009 and May 2010. Harvested fruit were sorted, packed, and placed in cold storage (2°C) for up to 3 weeks. Average counts of aerobic bacteria, total yeasts and molds, coliforms, and Escherichia coli on fruit samples before the cold storage period were below commercial tolerance levels in most cases. In both years, natural disease incidence after cold storage was lowest for hand-harvested crispy fruit and highest for machine-harvested conventional fruit. Interestingly, machine-harvested crispy fruit had the same or lower disease incidence as hand-harvested conventional fruit. Across all treatments, natural postharvest disease incidence was inversely related to fruit firmness, with firmness values 220 g/mm associated with low disease. In separate experiments, samples from the 0-day cold storage period were inoculated at the stem end with Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, or Colletotrichum acutatum, and disease incidence was assessed after 7 days in a cold room followed by 60 to 72 h at room temperature. In response to artificial inoculation, less disease developed on crispy berries. No significant effect of harvest method was observed, except for A. alternata inoculation in 2009, when hand-harvested fruit developed a lower level of disease than machine-harvested fruit. Taken together, this study suggests that mechanical harvesting of SHB cultivars with crisp-textured berries is feasible from a postharvest pathology perspective.","tags":null,"title":"Postharvest disease development on southern highbush blueberry fruit in relation to berry flesh type and harvest method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harald Scherm","**Lucky Mehra**","Dan MacLean"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1251763200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566236565,"objectID":"2556fb4e423ed489e051c2a07c96290d","permalink":"/publication/blueberry_dixie/","publishdate":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blueberry_dixie/","section":"publication","summary":"Historically (when production was focused almost exclusively on rabbiteye cultivars), pre- and postharvest fruit rots were not considered a significant issue in blueberries in Georgia.

Still, in most cases, these diseases are suppressed adequatly by routine fungicide applications and outbreaks occur only sporadically, often in response to excessive rainfall (as was the case in the spring of 2009).
