Something that would help bring together not just mentees, but the mentors also. I do understand that some mentors may have been too busy.\r\r\r\rN/A\r\r\r\rgenerally the program is good, maybe gather a little more info for applicants,such as a coverletter for intention, etc\r\r\r\r\rAnswers to question: What could be done to improve the program for students?\n\r\rMentor responses\r\r\r\r\r\rrun the length of the internship longer? Very hard to get in-depth projects finished in just few weeks.\r\r\r\rI think making the graduate school seminars optional would have improved the program for my student, because it is not common for people in her field to go to grad school. It was often hard to tare her away from her experiments to go to those seminars.\r\r\r\rNA\r\r\r\rI think more exposure would have been great: on social media, etc. I also think they would have benefited (or even found interesting labs to pursue) if either the hosting lab or the other labs had forums or seminars for either their post-docs or PIs. Something like the seminars Dr. Cook was in charge of last semester.\r\r\r\rN/A\r\r\r\rmaybe provide a detail instruction guide about life on campus and travel related info before they arrive, such as possible daily spending, reimbursement, etc\r\r\r\r\rAnswers to question: Is there anything else you would like to share with us about your experience as an REEU mentor?\n\r\rMentor responses\r\r\r\r\r\rNA\r\r\r\rI really enjoyed the REEU program.
