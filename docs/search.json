I do understand that some mentors may have been too busy.\r\r\r\rN/A\r\r\r\rgenerally the program is good, maybe gather a little more info for applicants,such as a coverletter for intention, etc\r\r\r\r\rAnswers to question: What could be done to improve the program for students?\n\r\rMentor responses\r\r\r\r\r\rrun the length of the internship longer? Very hard to get in-depth projects finished in just few weeks.\r\r\r\rI think making the graduate school seminars optional would have improved the program for my student, because it is not common for people in her field to go to grad school. It was often hard to tare her away from her experiments to go to those seminars.\r\r\r\rNA\r\r\r\rI think more exposure would have been great: on social media, etc. I also think they would have benefited (or even found interesting labs to pursue) if either the hosting lab or the other labs had forums or seminars for either their post-docs or PIs. Something like the seminars Dr. Cook was in charge of last semester.\r\r\r\rN/A\r\r\r\rmaybe provide a detail instruction guide about life on campus and travel related info before they arrive, such as possible daily spending, reimbursement, etc\r\r\r\r\rAnswers to question: Is there anything else you would like to share with us about your experience as an REEU mentor?\n\r\rMentor responses\r\r\r\r\r\rNA\r\r\r\rI really enjoyed the REEU program.

Greenhouse studies included five saflufenacil rates (0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 g ai ha−1) and three southern highbush blueberry cultivars (‘Legacy’, ‘New Hanover’, and ‘O’Neal’) and one rabbiteye blueberry cultivar (‘Columbus’). Saflufenacil treatments were soil applied into each pot when blueberry plants were approximately 30-cm tall. Visible injury (purpling/reddening of foliage and leaf abscission) ranged from 3% to 12%, 3% to 42%, 0% to 43%, and 0% to 29% with saflufenacil from 50 to 400 g ha−1 in Columbus, Legacy, New Hanover, and O’Neal, respectively, at 28 d after treatment. Regardless of injury, plant growth (change in height), soil plant analysis development, and whole-plant dry biomass of all cultivars did not differ among saflufenacil rates. Field studies were conducted in Burgaw, NC, to determine the tolerance of nonbearing (3-yr-old and mature enough to produce fruit) southern highbush blueberry (‘Duke’) to saflufenacil application at pre-budbreak or during the vegetative growth stage. Treatments included three rates of saflufenacil (50, 100, and 200 g ha−1), glyphosate (870 g ae ha−1), glufosinate (1096 g ai ha−1), glyphosate (870 g ha−1) + saflufenacil (50 g ha−1), glufosinate (1096 g ha−1) + saflufenacil (50 g ha−1), and hexazinone (1,120 g ai ha−1), applied POST-directed to the soil surface beneath blueberry plants in a 76-cm band on both sides of the blueberry planting row. The maximum injury from treatments containing saflufenacil was ≤11% in both nonbearing and bearing blueberry. No negative effects on plant growth or fruit yield were observed from any treatments. Results from both greenhouse and field studies suggest that saflufenacil applied at 50 (1X commercial use rate) and 100 g ha−1 is safe to use in blueberry.","tags":null,"title":"Tolerance of southern highbush and rabbiteye blueberry cultivars to saflufenacil.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Mehra, L.**","Adhikari, U.","Cowger, C.","Ojiambo, P.

The disease affects both the quantity and quality of yield, and the pathogen is capable of affecting wheat at both seedling and adult stages. Historically, losses up to 50% have been reported, in addition to lower grain quality, although in the U.S., lower levels of loss are typical. The yield losses are highest when flag leaf, F-1 (leaf below flag leaf), and F-2 (leaf below F-1) are infected. The disease is known to reduce thousand-kernel-weight, a yield parameter.The fungus undergoes regular cycles of sexual recombination due to the availability of both mating types, and creates genetic variation in its population, thus enhancing its potential to overcome control measures.  The pathosystem is also a model system for necrotrophic plant pathogens.

The experiments included VFSW of 0, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3, or 3.6 m under irrigated or nonirrigated conditions. Seasonal variation in the orchard floor vegetation was observed as different weed species reported in summer and winter. However, this difference was not apparent with respect to VFSF and irrigation. At Jackson Springs, NC, the predicted irrigated VFSW which would produce the same trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) as the grower standard (3-m nonirrigated) was 1.5, 1.3, and 0.8 m for one-, two-, and three-year-old trees, respectively. The predicted irrigated VFSW which would produce the same yield as the grower standard was 1.16 m. At Clayton, TCSA and fruit yield were not different by irrigation, but did increase linearly with VFSW. At both locations, leaf nitrogen (N) concentration was lower in irrigated trees than nonirrigated trees. Leaf N, leaf area, and SPAD were positively related to VFSW at Jackson Springs. In contrast, leaf N concentration was not different by VFSW at Clayton. However, leaf area and SPAD were positively related to VFSW at Clayton. These results suggest that a 1.5 m VFSW combined with proper irrigation and fertilization will produce tree growth and yield in newly planted orchard with volunteer weedy vegetation similar to the current grower standard in the southeastern USA.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of Vegetation-Free Strip Width and Irrigation on Newly Planted Peach.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sahayaraj, K.","Subash, N.","Allingham, R.

The objective of this study was to assess their effects on the biological parameters of *Spodoptera litura* (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae, and its natural reduviid predator *Rhynocoris kumarii* (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) under laboratory conditions. Results suggested that *P. fluorescens* reduced the food consumption index, relative growth rate, approximate digestibility, the efficiency of conversion of ingested food, and the efficiency of conversion of digested food of *S. litura* third instar larvae compared to prey infected with *M. anisopliae* and SpltNPV. Both SpltNPV and *M. anisopliae* caused similar mortality of *S. litura* life stages after 96 h of observation. To observe the effect of an infected prey diet on predator behavior, infected *S. litura* larvae were offered to the third, fourth, and fifth instar nymphs of *R. kumarii*, and their prey handling time, predation rate (number/day/predator), developmental period, and the survival rate was recorded. When the life stages of *R. kumarii* were offered entomopathogen-infected *S. litura* larvae, their predation rate was comparable to or higher than the untreated control. The juvenile predator, after feeding on *P. fluorescens*-infected *S. litura* larvae, had a significantly longer developmental period (2–4 days) compared to those fed on larvae infected with other microbial control agents. However, feeding on *P. fluorescens* alone did not affect the predator nymphal survival rate or the adult sex ratio. Although three entomopathogens had some degree of effect on the biological parameters of *R. kumarii*, the outcome of this study suggests that integration of reduviids with the tested entomopathogens are a compatible and potentially effective strategy for the management of *S. litura* populations. However promising, this combined strategy needs to be tested under field conditions to confirm the laboratory findings.","tags":null,"title":"Lethal and sublethal effects of three microbial biocontrol agents on *Spodoptera litura* and its natural predator *Rhynocoris kumarii*.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cowger, C.","**Mehra, L.**","Arellano, C.","Meyers, E.","Murphy, J.

A virulence survey of *Blumeria graminis* f. sp. *tritici*, the causal agent, was conducted by sampling 36 wheat fields in 15 U.S. states in the years 2013 and 2014. Using a hierarchical sampling protocol, isolates were derived from three separated plants at each of five separated sites within each field in order to assess the spatial distribution of pathotypes. In total, 1,017 isolates from those fields were tested individually on single-gene differential cultivars containing a total of 21 powdery mildew resistance (Pm) genes. Several recently introgressed mildew resistance genes from wild wheat relatives (Pm37, Pm53, MlAG12, NCAG13, and MlUM15) exhibited complete or nearly complete resistance to all local B. graminis f. sp. tritici populations from across the sampled area. One older gene, Pm4b, also retained at least some efficacy across the sampled area. The B. graminis f. sp. tritici population sampled from Arkansas and Missouri, on the western edge of the eastern soft red winter wheat region, had virulence profiles more similar to other soft wheat mildew populations than to the geographically closer population from hard wheat fields in the Plains states of Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Kansas. The Plains population differed in that it was avirulent to several Pm genes long defeated in the soft-wheat-growing areas. Virulence complexity was greatest east of the Mississippi River, and diminished toward the west. Several recently introgressed Pm genes (Pm25, Pm34, Pm35, and NCA6) that are highly effective against mildew in the field in North Carolina were unexpectedly susceptible to eastern-U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici populations in detached-leaf tests. Sampled fields displayed a wide range of pathotype diversity and spatial distribution, suggesting that epidemics are caused by varying numbers of pathotypes in all regions. The research confirmed that most long-used Pm genes are defeated in the eastern United States, and the U.S. B. graminis f. sp. tritici population has different virulence profiles in the hard- and soft-wheat regions, which are likely maintained by host selection, isolation by distance, and west-to-east gene flow.","tags":null,"title":"Virulence differences in Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici from the central and eastern United States.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ojiambo, P.

Although SNB can occur prior to flag leaf emergence, the relationship between the time of disease onset and yield has not been determined. Such a relationship is useful in identifying a threshold to facilitate prediction of disease onset in the field. Disease occurred in 390 of 435 disease cases that were recorded across 11 counties in North Carolina from 2012 to 2014. Using cases with disease occurrence, the effect of disease onset on yield was analyzed to identify a disease onset threshold that related time of disease onset to yield. Regression analysis showed that disease onset explained 32% of the variation in yield (P 0.90. Performance of the disease onset model based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), κ, and the true skill statistic (TSS) was excellent, with prediction accuracy values 0.88.

In this study, we examined the performance of multiple regression (MR) and three machine learning algorithms namely artificial neural networks, categorical and regression trees, and random forests (RF), in predicting the pre-planting risk of SNB in wheat. Pre-planting factors tested as potential predictor variables were cultivar resistance, latitude, longitude, previous crop, seeding rate, seed treatment, tillage type, and wheat residue. Disease severity assessed at the end of the growing season was used as the response variable. The models were developed using 431 disease cases (unique combinations of predictors) collected from 2012 to 2014 and these cases were randomly divided into training, validation, and test datasets. Models were evaluated based on the regression of observed against predicted severity values of SNB, sensitivity-specificity ROC analysis, and the Kappa statistic. A strong relationship was observed between late-season severity of SNB and specific pre-planting factors in which latitude, longitude, wheat residue, and cultivar resistance were the most important predictors. The MR model explained 33% of variability in the data, while machine learning models explained 47 to 79% of the total variability. Similarly, the MR model correctly classified 74% of the disease cases, while machine learning models correctly classified 81 to 83% of these cases. Results show that the RF algorithm, which explained 79% of the variability within the data, was the most accurate in predicting the risk of SNB, with an accuracy rate of 93%.

Because the risk of infection is increased by fruit bruising, which in turn is increased by machine-harvesting, it has been difficult to harvest fruit from the early-maturing but soft-textured southern highbush blueberries (SHB) mechanically for the fresh market. This could change fundamentally with the recent development of SHB genotypes with crisp-textured (“crispy”) berries, i.e., fruit with qualitatively firmer flesh and/or more resistant skin. Four replicate row sections of two or three SHB genotypes having crispy fruit and three with conventional fruit were either hand- or machine-harvested at a commercial blueberry farm in northern Florida in April 2009 and May 2010. Harvested fruit were sorted, packed, and placed in cold storage (2°C) for up to 3 weeks. Average counts of aerobic bacteria, total yeasts and molds, coliforms, and Escherichia coli on fruit samples before the cold storage period were below commercial tolerance levels in most cases. In both years, natural disease incidence after cold storage was lowest for hand-harvested crispy fruit and highest for machine-harvested conventional fruit. Interestingly, machine-harvested crispy fruit had the same or lower disease incidence as hand-harvested conventional fruit. Across all treatments, natural postharvest disease incidence was inversely related to fruit firmness, with firmness values 220 g/mm associated with low disease. In separate experiments, samples from the 0-day cold storage period were inoculated at the stem end with Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, or Colletotrichum acutatum, and disease incidence was assessed after 7 days in a cold room followed by 60 to 72 h at room temperature. In response to artificial inoculation, less disease developed on crispy berries. No significant effect of harvest method was observed, except for A. alternata inoculation in 2009, when hand-harvested fruit developed a lower level of disease than machine-harvested fruit. Taken together, this study suggests that mechanical harvesting of SHB cultivars with crisp-textured berries is feasible from a postharvest pathology perspective.","tags":null,"title":"Postharvest disease development on southern highbush blueberry fruit in relation to berry flesh type and harvest method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harald Scherm","**Lucky Mehra**","Dan MacLean"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1251763200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1251763200,"objectID":"2556fb4e423ed489e051c2a07c96290d","permalink":"/publication/blueberry_dixie/","publishdate":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blueberry_dixie/","section":"publication","summary":"Historically (when production was focused almost exclusively on rabbiteye cultivars), pre- and postharvest fruit rots were not considered a significant issue in blueberries in Georgia.

The situation has changed with the rapid expansion of the southern highbush industry during the past decade, owing to the greater susceptibility of southern highbush cultivars in general to the fungal pathogens causing rot diseases. Still, in most cases, these diseases are suppressed adequatly by routine fungicide applications and outbreaks occur only sporadically, often in response to excessive rainfall (as was the case in the spring of 2009). Because of the sporadic nature of fruit rot epidemics in Georgia, there is limited information on the composition of the pathogen complex involved, in cultivar susceptibility to different fruit rot pathogens, and on factors influencing fruit rot incidence.","tags":null,"title":"Observations on fruit rots in a southern highbush harvesting experiment, 2009.","type":"publication"}]
