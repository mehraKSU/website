It was often hard to tare her away from her experiments to go to those seminars. ","I really enjoyed the REEU program.  Everyone was wonderful to work with.  I learned a lot in the mentor training session.  We generated good data, had a lot of fun, and learned from each other.  What a great experience!"

Something that would help bring together not just mentees, but the mentors also. I do understand that some mentors may have been too busy. ","I think more exposure would have been great: on social media, etc. I also think they would have benefited (or even found interesting labs to pursue) if either the hosting lab or the other labs had forums or seminars for either their post-docs or PIs. Something like the seminars Dr. Cook was in charge of last semester. ",It was fun and interesting. My mentee and I were able to learn from each other and discuss potential plans in the future- either in academia or the industry.
