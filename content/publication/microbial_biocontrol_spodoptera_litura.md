abstract = "Entomopathogenic microbes such as *Spodoptera litura* nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpltNPV), *Metarhizium anisopliae*, and *Pseudomonas fluorescens* are biological agents used for the control of multiple arthropod pests. The objective of this study was to assess their effects on the biological parameters of *Spodoptera litura* (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae, and its natural reduviid predator *Rhynocoris kumarii* (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) under laboratory conditions. Results suggested that *P. fluorescens* reduced the food consumption index, relative growth rate, approximate digestibility, the efficiency of conversion of ingested food, and the efficiency of conversion of digested food of *S. litura* third instar larvae compared to prey infected with *M. anisopliae* and SpltNPV. Both SpltNPV and *M. anisopliae* caused similar mortality of *S. litura* life stages after 96 h of observation. To observe the effect of an infected prey diet on predator behavior, infected *S. litura* larvae were offered to the third, fourth, and fifth instar nymphs of *R. kumarii*, and their prey handling time, predation rate (number/day/predator), developmental period, and the survival rate was recorded. When the life stages of *R. kumarii* were offered entomopathogen-infected *S. litura* larvae, their predation rate was comparable to or higher than the untreated control. The juvenile predator, after feeding on *P. fluorescens*-infected *S. litura* larvae, had a significantly longer developmental period (2â€“4 days) compared to those fed on larvae infected with other microbial control agents. However, feeding on *P. fluorescens* alone did not affect the predator nymphal survival rate or the adult sex ratio. Although three entomopathogens had some degree of effect on the biological parameters of *R. kumarii*, the outcome of this study suggests that integration of reduviids with the tested entomopathogens are a compatible and potentially effective strategy for the management of *S. litura* populations. However promising, this combined strategy needs to be tested under field conditions to confirm the laboratory findings."
