I am an instructor in the Department of Plant Pathology at Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS. I teach Principles of Plant Pathology (PLPTH 500) that is offered every spring semester. This is a fundamental course in plant pathology that introduces students to nature of plant pathogens and to cause, effect, and management of plant diseases. I also coordinate [undergraduate minor in plant pathology](https://www.plantpath.k-state.edu/undergraduate/plant-path-minor.html).

I am a plant disease epidemiologist by training. I worked on epidemiology of Septoria nodorum blotch during my PhD from North Carolina State University, Raleigh. In my MS, I worked on postharvest diseases of blueberry and pomegranate at University of Georgia, Athens.

In addition to plant pathology, I love data analysis and programming in R, SAS, and python. In my free time, I enjoy reading news (mainly technology), watching TV, hiking, singing rhymes with my daughter, and gardening.
